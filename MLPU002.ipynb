        "\n",
        "\n",
        "首先PU Learning针对的数据分布是Positive data和Unlabeled data，和通常正反例不同，而是正例和未打标数据，这样的数据集在实际生产和生活中经常存在。\n",
        "比如，如果我们认为一个患者确诊某一疾病是正例，那会有大量的人群是Unlabeled状态，但Unlabeled不代表没有患病更不能看作负例；\n",
        "还有推荐系统，通常认为用户点击是正例，未点击是负例，这建立在认为曝光等于真实触达的先验假设之上，但可能用户的视线压根就没有看到该位置，根本就没有触达，这时便属于Unlabeled状态；在游戏中也是这样，如果视野内某个位置出现了金币我们可以认为该坐标是正例，那其他未探索的地图也是Unlabeled状态。\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "对于这样的场景，我们希望模型能够通过在正例和未标记样例上学得正例在整体样本空间下的真实分布情况，比如通过确诊病例和没来看病的人群数据，我们可以预估该疾病到底在整体人群中的发病率是多少；通过用户点击数据和下发曝光数据判断真实CTR值；通过已经获得的金币和未探索的地图信息，知道整张地图的金币数分布等。\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "对于以上问题，可以概括为：在正例-未打标样本的非标准数据集（标准数据集指正例-负例形式）上训练一个与标准数据集下相近的分类器，从而缓解样本分布上的偏差。这一学习过程我们希望和在正负例上直接训练的效果接近，在实际应用中，通过分类器提供的可以在未标注数据上预测其为正例的概率，产生实际价值。\n",

        "假设您有一个支付交易数据集。一些交易被标记为欺诈交易，其余交易被标记为真实交易，您需要设计一个模型来区分欺诈交易和真实交易。假设您有足够的数据和良好的特征，这似乎是一个简单的分类任务。但是，假设只有 15% 的数据被标记，并且标记的样本仅属于一个类别，于是您的训练集包含 15% 标记为真实的样本，而其余样本则未标记，可能是真实的，也可能是欺诈的。你会如何对它们进行分类？需求的这种变化是否只是将这项任务变成了无监督学习问题？嗯，不一定。\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "第一种也是最常见的标签问题是小训练集的问题。当尽管您拥有相当数量的数据，但实际上只有一小部分被标记时，就会出现这种情况。这个问题有很多种，具体的训练方法也有很多。\n",
        "\n",
        "另一个常见的标记问题（通常与 PU 问题混为一谈）涉及这样的情况：我们的训练数据集已完全标记，但它仅包含一个类。例如，假设我们拥有的只是一个非欺诈交易的数据集，并且我们需要使用该数据集来训练一个模型来区分（类似的）非欺诈交易和欺诈交易。这也是一个常见问题，通常被视为无监督异常值检测问题，尽管在 ML 领域也有很多广泛使用的工具是专门为处理这些场景而设计的（OneClassSVM 可能是最著名的）。\n",
        "\n",
        "相反，PU 分类问题是涉及训练集的情况，其中只有部分数据被标记为正，而其余数据未标记，并且可以是正的或负的。例如，假设你的雇主是一家银行，可以为你提供大量交易数据，但只能确认其中一部分是100%真实的。我将在这里使用的示例涉及与欺诈钞票相关的类似场景。它包含 1200 张纸币的数据集，其中大部分没有标签，只有部分被确认为真品。尽管 PU 问题也很常见，但与前面提到的两个分类问题相比，它们的讨论通常要少得多，并且广泛可用的实践示例或库也很少。"
